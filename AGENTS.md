# AGENTS.md - NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit AI Agent Entry Point

AI agent skills for the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit live in **`skills/`** at the repository root and use a **flat layout**. Read this file first, then choose skills from the task routing index below.

## Mandatory Repository Rules

- Preserve user changes. Check `git status` before editing and do not revert unrelated work.
- Prefer existing project patterns, examples, and documentation over new abstractions.
- Do not add dependencies, update lock files, or run package installation commands unless the task requires it.
- Use the full product name "NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit" on first use in public documentation, then "NeMo Agent Toolkit" or "the toolkit". Use `nat` only for the CLI, Python namespace, package metadata, and other technical identifiers.
- Keep examples runnable from the repository root unless the surrounding file uses a different convention.
- For ambiguous tasks, clarify the intended outcome or cover each plausible interpretation and report what you did.

## Skills Directory (Flat)

- `skills/nat-user-rules/` - General behavior, naming conventions, discovery rules, and task routing.
- `skills/nat-installation/` - Installation, optional extras, CLI verification, and first workflow setup.
- `skills/nat-workflow-creation/` - Workflow YAML authoring, component discovery, LLM configuration, and common CLI commands.
- `skills/nat-agent-configuration/` - Agent selection, built-in agent configuration, control flow, and sub-agent composition.
- `skills/nat-tools-and-functions/` - Custom functions, tools, function groups, and Python extension patterns.
- `skills/nat-evaluation/` - Evaluation methodology, datasets, evaluator selection, ATIF surfaces, and `nat eval`.
- `skills/nat-optimization/` - `nat optimize`, optimizer configuration, parameter selection, and output interpretation.
- `skills/nat-telemetry/` - Logging, tracing, profiling, OpenTelemetry, and telemetry exporters.
- `skills/nat-mcp-and-serving/` - MCP clients and servers, FastAPI, and workflow serving.
- `skills/nat-path-checks/` - Documentation path-check failures, Markdown escaping, and slash-delimited token fixes.
- `skills/skill-evolution/` - Creating, refining, and maintaining AI coding agent skills.

## Task Routing

Use the routing table before opening detailed references inside the skill.

| Task | Skill and Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Installing or configuring NeMo Agent Toolkit | `skills/nat-installation/SKILL.md` |
| Discovering registered component `_type` values | `skills/nat-workflow-creation/SKILL.md` |
| Writing or editing workflow YAML | `skills/nat-workflow-creation/SKILL.md` |
| Configuring LLMs | `skills/nat-workflow-creation/SKILL.md` |
| Choosing or configuring agents | `skills/nat-agent-configuration/SKILL.md` |
| Writing custom tools or functions | `skills/nat-tools-and-functions/SKILL.md` |
| Wiring MCP client or server workflows | `skills/nat-mcp-and-serving/SKILL.md` |
| Serving with FastAPI | `skills/nat-mcp-and-serving/SKILL.md` |
| Composing sub-agents | `skills/nat-agent-configuration/SKILL.md` |
| Adding tracing or telemetry | `skills/nat-telemetry/SKILL.md` |
| Designing an evaluation suite | `skills/nat-evaluation/SKILL.md` |
| Choosing an evaluator | `skills/nat-evaluation/SKILL.md` |
| Running `nat optimize` | `skills/nat-optimization/SKILL.md` |
| Fixing documentation path-check failures | `skills/nat-path-checks/SKILL.md` |
| Creating or improving skills | `skills/skill-evolution/SKILL.md` |

## Skill Evolution

When a user corrects your approach, a command fails and you recover, or you discover a generalizable gotcha, finish the task first and then read `skills/skill-evolution/SKILL.md` to decide whether the skills should be updated.

## Quick Commands

Run commands from the repository root unless a skill or package README says otherwise.

```bash
uv run nat --help
uv run pytest packages/nvidia_nat_core
NAT_DISABLE_API_BUILD=1 make -C docs html
```

For local documentation details, read `docs/README.md`. For contribution details, read `docs/source/resources/contributing/index.md`.
