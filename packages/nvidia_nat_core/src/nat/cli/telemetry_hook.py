"""CLI-side telemetry plumbing.

This module exists so that telemetry concerns stay out of `entrypoint.py` and
`main.py`. The integration is a thin pair of helpers:

- :func:`record_invocation_start` — called by the Click group callback, stashes
  a session ID and timestamp on the Click context.
- :func:`emit_command_event` — called by the entry-point wrapper after the CLI
  exits (success, interrupt, or failure), constructs and enqueues a
  :class:`CliCommandEvent`.

All public functions swallow exceptions: telemetry must never disrupt the host
CLI invocation.

    """Recover the second-level command name, validated against the registered
    Click command tree.

    Click does not expose nested ``invoked_subcommand`` from the root context,
    so we scan ``sys.argv`` for a candidate token. We only return a token if
    it matches the name of an *actually registered* subcommand of the
    ``top_level`` group. This is the privacy boundary: positional arguments
    (file paths, workflow names, free-form queries) cannot match a registered
    subcommand name and therefore cannot leak.

    To prevent option-value tokens that appear *later* on the command line
    from being misclassified as the subcommand, the scan only considers the
    **first non-flag token after** ``top_level``. Anything later — even if
    it happens to spell a subcommand name — is ignored.

    Known limitation: an option whose *value* (e.g. ``--filter list-components``)
    appears before the subcommand position can still be picked up here,
    because we cannot infer Click option metadata from raw argv. The exposure
    is bounded — the value must exactly match a registered subcommand name —
    and is fully eliminated only by switching to Click's parsed context tree.

    Returns ``None`` when:

    - The root command isn't a Click group (callable from non-CLI contexts).
    - ``top_level`` isn't a registered subcommand of the root group.
    - The resolved top-level command is itself a leaf (not a group), so no
      second level is possible.
    - The first non-flag token after ``top_level`` doesn't match a
      registered subcommand.
    - ``top_level`` doesn't appear in ``sys.argv`` at all.
