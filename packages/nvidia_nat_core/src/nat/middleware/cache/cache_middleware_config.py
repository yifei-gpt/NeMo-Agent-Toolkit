    """Configuration for cache middleware.

    The cache middleware memoizes function outputs based on input similarity,
    with support for both exact and fuzzy matching.

    Args:
        enabled_mode: Controls when caching is active:
            - "always": Cache is always enabled
            - "eval": Cache only active when Context.is_evaluating is True
        similarity_threshold: Float in [0, 1.0] for input matching:
            - 1.0: Exact string matching (fastest, recommended)
            - < 1.0: Fuzzy matching via difflib. Note that difflib is
              quadratic in the worst case, so large caches with low
              thresholds may have a performance cost. Values near 0
              increase the risk of cache collisions where different
              inputs return the same cached response.
        max_entries: Upper bound on cached entries. When exceeded, the
            least-recently-used entry is evicted. Must be a positive int;
            defaults to 1024.
