"""Registered JSON Schemas for validating ATOF ``event.data`` payloads.

The ATOF envelope carries an optional ``data_schema = {name, version}``
identifier declaring the shape of ``event.data``. Spec §2 leaves schema
validation to the consumer.

This module maintains a process-wide registry keyed on
``(name, version) -> JSON Schema dict`` and ships one built-in schema:

- ``openai/chat-completions@1`` — permissive shape check for LLM
  scope-start and scope-end payloads; accepts any object carrying at
  least one of the extractable top-level keys: ``messages``, ``content``,
  ``tool_calls``, ``choices``.

External producers register their own schemas via :func:`register_schema`::

    from nat.atof.schemas import register_schema

    register_schema("myco/my-payload", "1", {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["myco_field"],
    })

Consumers validate an event by looking up the schema and calling
:func:`jsonschema.validate`. The ATOF→ATIF converter wires this into
its pre-pass and raises ``DataSchemaViolationError`` on failure.

DESIGN NOTE: Producer-Declared Schema Discovery (Future)
========================================================

Today, registering a non-default schema/extractor is a consumer-side
concern: the consumer calls :func:`register_schema` and
:func:`nat.atof.extractors.register_llm_extractor` (or one of the
``register_*_v1()`` convenience helpers) **before** invoking the
converter. The producer declares ``data_schema = {name, version}`` per
event but offers no mechanism to *deliver* the schema or extractor logic
along with the stream. This works fine when the consumer knows the
producer in advance (the ATOF v0.1 expectation) but becomes friction
once a single consumer wants to ingest streams from multiple producers
without prior coordination — e.g. a forensics tool replaying old
trajectories from a producer it has never seen.

Three design options are on the table for a future ATOF revision; none
are implemented yet. Captured here so the next iteration doesn't
relitigate the trade-off space:

(A) **Stream-level schema manifest** — Reserve the first line of the
    JSONL stream for a non-event manifest::

        {"type": "atof_schema_manifest",
         "schemas": [{"name": ..., "version": ..., "json_schema": {...},
                      "extractor_plugin": "anthropic.messages.v1"}]}

    Consumers parse the manifest, register declared schemas + extractor
    plugins, then process events normally. **Pros**: backward-compat
    (consumers ignore unknown first line), explicit, easy to ship.
    **Cons**: requires a new wire-format reservation; ``extractor_plugin``
    references opaque code (security and trust concerns).

(B) **ATOF-native metadata on root scope-start** — Embed the manifest
    in ``metadata._atof_schemas`` on the root agent ScopeStart event.
    Already-permitted by spec §2.1 (open metadata). **Pros**: no wire
    format change, zero-overhead for streams that don't use it.
    **Cons**: late discovery (consumer can't pre-register before seeing
    events), and requires every producer to remember this convention.

(C) **Out-of-band manifest file** — Ship a sidecar manifest alongside
    the JSONL (e.g. ``trajectory.jsonl`` + ``trajectory.manifest.json``).
    Consumers load both. **Pros**: clean separation; schemas can be
    versioned and signed independently. **Cons**: two-file coupling is
    fragile; transport-level constraints (logs systems, kafka) often
    drop sidecars.

Recommendation when the work is taken up: prototype (A) first — it's
the least invasive and is self-documenting in the stream itself.
Decline (C) unless storage transports demand it. (B) is a cheap
fallback if (A) hits backward-compat blockers.

This block is the architectural commitment record. Update it when the
decision is made; do not expand the registry/helpers in this module
without a corresponding spec amendment.
