"""Canonical attribute flags for ATOF scope events (spec §2.1).

Serializes as a canonical (sorted, deduplicated) lowercase string array. The
vocabulary is shared across all categories; applicability per category is
documented in spec §2.1. Consumers MUST preserve unknown flag strings when
re-emitting and MUST NOT treat unknown flags as errors — vendor extensions
following the ``vendor.name`` dotted-namespace convention are forward-compat.
