# ATOF-to-ATIF Examples

End-to-end examples exercising the ATOF v0.1 reference implementation. Six scenarios cover the two enrichment tiers, the `mark` event kind, and three real-world LLM payload shapes (OpenAI chat-completions, Anthropic Messages, Gemini `generateContent`) plus a heterogeneous orchestrator that mixes all three in a single stream. See spec §1.1 in [`../../atof-event-format.md`](../../atof-event-format.md) for tier definitions and §3 for event kinds.

This README doubles as the ATOF → ATIF conversion reference: the mapping table, dispatch conventions, and known limitations live in the [Conversion reference](#conversion-reference) section at the bottom.

## Scripts

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
- `generate_atof_examples.py` — produces `./output/exmpNN_atof.jsonl` for each scenario using the v0.1 public API (`scope` / `mark` event models, `write_jsonl`).
- `convert_atof_examples_to_atif.py` — reads each regenerated JSONL, runs the ATOF→ATIF converter (`nat.atof.scripts.atof_to_atif_converter.convert_file`), and writes `./output/exmpNN_atif.json` as a formatted ATIF `Trajectory`.

## The scenarios

Each subsection below ends with a Phoenix span tree screenshot taken after exporting the converted ATIF JSON to a local Arize Phoenix instance. See [Verifying in Phoenix](#verifying-in-phoenix) for the export command.

### EXMP-01 — tier-1 raw pass-through

A calculator-shaped workflow where the producer can't classify any scope. Every `scope` event carries `category: "unknown"`, `category_profile: null`, and opaque raw JSON in `data`. Demonstrates the floor: a valid ATOF stream capturing only timing + raw payloads, with no semantic tagging.

Converts to an ATIF trajectory shaped as **user → opaque system steps → agent**: the root opaque scope's start payload (e.g. `{"raw_query": "..."}`) is lifted into a leading `source: "user"` step (Branch A), the inner unclassified scope-ends each become `source: "system"` steps via the generic fall-through, and the root opaque scope's end payload (e.g. `{"raw_result": "..."}`) is lifted into a trailing `source: "agent"` step (Branch B). `Trajectory.agent.name` uses the outermost root scope's `name` since no `category: "agent"` event is present.

**When to use:** a runtime wrapping a third-party framework whose callback fires a raw blob the wrapper can't classify, but where the producer still places the user objective on the root scope-start and the agent's final result on the root scope-end.

![EXMP-01 Phoenix span tree](_static/atif-exmp01-tier1-raw-passthrough.png)

### EXMP-02 — tier-2 semantic-tagged

Same calculator workflow as EXMP-01 but with every scope classified (`category: "agent"` / `"llm"` / `"tool"`) and `category_profile` populated (`category_profile.model_name` for LLM events, `category_profile.tool_call_id` for tool events — see spec §4.4). Additionally demonstrates `attributes: ["remote"]` on the tool scope (the tool is dispatched out-of-process, spec §2.1) and `data_schema` on the LLM scopes pointing at `openai/chat-completions@1` (spec §2).

Converts to a rich ATIF trajectory with user / agent / observation steps, with `Trajectory.agent.name` derived from the `category: "agent"` scope's `name`. The Phoenix view shows the LLM span with a child TOOL span carrying the calculator invocation.

**When to use:** native producers that classify events at the hook site.

![EXMP-02 Phoenix span tree](_static/atif-exmp02-tier2-semantic-tagged.png)

### EXMP-03 — mark events (in-line guardrail)

A short chat agent that fires a single in-line `mark` event mid-trajectory. The mark is `category: "guardrail"` (a first-class spec category per [`atof-event-format.md`](../../atof-event-format.md) §4), parented under the agent scope, and fires AFTER the agent scope-start and BEFORE the LLM scope-start — riding alongside the agent's lifecycle rather than bracketing it. The mark records an input-safety policy check (`{"check": "input_safety", "passed": true, "policies": ["prompt_injection", "pii"]}`).

Because the mark's `data` shape doesn't match a role-extraction heuristic, the converter takes the JSON-blob fall-through arm at [`atof_to_atif_converter.py`](../../src/nat/atof/scripts/atof_to_atif_converter.py) lines 622-651: the mark surfaces as a `source: "system"` step whose `message` is the compact-JSON serialization of the mark's `data`. The single LLM turn produces the user / agent pair. Phoenix's native ATIF helper renders pre-LLM `source: "system"` steps inline as `llm.input_messages` on the LLM span. Trailing system steps after the only LLM call have nowhere to attach and are not surfaced in the UI — input-side guardrails are also more common in production (rejected prompts skip the LLM cost), so this position is doubly justified. The Phoenix view shows the workflow span with the `input_safety_check` guardrail folded into the LLM span's `llm.input_messages` alongside the user message, demonstrating that marks are in-line lifecycle checkpoints, not session brackets.

**When to use:** demonstrating in-line, categorized lifecycle checkpoints — guardrail / safety / compliance markers that ride alongside agent scopes without taking start and end pairing semantics.

![EXMP-03 Phoenix span tree](_static/atif-exmp03-guardrail-mark-event.png)

### EXMP-04 — Anthropic Messages

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
A document-summarization workflow where Claude calls a `read_file` tool and then formulates a summary. LLM payloads use Anthropic's Messages API shape — `messages[].content` is polymorphic string-or-block-list on input; `content[]` is a typed-block list on output, mixing `text` and `tool_use` blocks. Every LLM scope declares `data_schema = {"name": "anthropic/messages", "version": "1"}`, dispatching to a registered Anthropic-specific extractor.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

Demonstrates that the converter handles polymorphic content shapes through the registered extractor's normalization hooks. Tool calls extracted from `content[].tool_use` blocks resolve correctly into ATIF `tool_calls[]` with the matching observation results.

**When to use:** any producer emitting Claude or other Anthropic-shape payloads. Mirror this scenario when registering a new LLM-payload extractor.

![EXMP-04 Phoenix span tree](_static/atif-exmp04-anthropic-messages.png)

### EXMP-05 — Gemini `generateContent`

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
A timezone lookup workflow where Gemini calls a `get_current_time` function and then answers. LLM payloads use Gemini's `contents[].parts[]` request shape and `candidates[0].content.parts[]` response shape. Every LLM scope declares `data_schema = {"name": "gemini/generate-content", "version": "1"}`.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

Demonstrates two Gemini-specific quirks the registered extractor smooths over: role aliasing (Gemini's `"model"` role maps to `"assistant"`) and tool-call-id synthesis (Gemini omits IDs, so the extractor synthesizes `<function-name>__<index>` to keep ATIF observation-result correlation intact).

**When to use:** any producer emitting Gemini or Vertex AI `generateContent` payloads. Reference for extractors that need to synthesize provider-missing identifiers.

![EXMP-05 Phoenix span tree](_static/atif-exmp05-gemini-generate-content.png)

### EXMP-06 — Heterogeneous router

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
A multi-provider orchestrator that receives a single user request, routes pieces to three specialist LLMs from different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), and combines their responses. The single ATOF stream carries three LLM scope events, each declaring a different `data_schema` — `openai/chat-completions@1`, `anthropic/messages@1`, and `gemini/generate-content@1` in turn.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

This is the strongest end-to-end evidence that the converter dispatches **per event** by schema, not per stream. Each LLM span in the Phoenix tree below was parsed by a different registered extractor, yet they coexist under a single trajectory and trace.

Per-step `step.model_name` (ATIF v1.7) describes which provider produced each agent step: the three LLM-derived agent steps in the converted ATIF carry `model_name: "gpt-4o"` (router), `model_name: "claude-3-5-sonnet"` (code synthesis), and `model_name: "gemini-2.0-flash"` (math) respectively, while the root `agent.model_name = "gpt-4o"` reflects only the first LLM scope-end (the orchestrator/router). A consumer that previously had to guess which model produced step 5 can now read the answer off the step itself.

**When to use:** any orchestrator pattern where one workflow fans out to multiple providers. Demonstrates that no schema-switching ceremony is needed at the producer side beyond declaring `data_schema` on each event.

## Verifying in Phoenix

The screenshots above were captured by exporting the generated ATIF JSON files to a local Arize Phoenix instance through the [`export_atif_trajectory_to_phoenix`](../../../nvidia_nat_phoenix/src/nat/plugins/phoenix/scripts/export_trajectory_to_phoenix/README.md) script.

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 4317:4317 -p 6006:6006 --name phoenix arizephoenix/phoenix:13.22

uv pip install -e packages/nvidia_nat_phoenix

uv run python -m nat.plugins.phoenix.scripts.export_trajectory_to_phoenix.export_atif_trajectory_to_phoenix \
    packages/nvidia_nat_atif/examples/atof_to_atif/output/exmp0{1,2,3,4,5,6}_atif.json \
    --project atof-pr-1890-examples
```

Open the Phoenix UI at `http://localhost:6006`, select the `atof-pr-1890-examples` project, and the six traces appear with the span trees shown above.

## Event counts

| Scenario | Events | Tier | Workflow                                                           |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EXMP-01  | 8      | 1    | Opaque wrapper: three unclassified inner callbacks                 |
| EXMP-02  | 8      | 2    | Calculator: agent → LLM → tool → LLM → agent                       |
| EXMP-03  | 5      | 2    | Chat agent with in-line guardrail mark                             |
| EXMP-04  | 8      | 2    | Claude document summarizer with `read_file` tool (Anthropic shape) |
| EXMP-05  | 8      | 2    | Gemini timezone lookup with `get_current_time` function            |
| EXMP-06  | 8      | 2    | Multi-provider router: OpenAI + Anthropic + Gemini in one stream   |

EXMP-01, EXMP-02, EXMP-04, EXMP-05, and EXMP-06 each consist of paired `scope` events. EXMP-03 consists of two paired `scope` events (one agent + one LLM) plus a single in-line `mark` event. The ATOF v0.1 spec has no stream-level metadata event.

## Conversion reference

This section is the canonical mapping from ATOF event streams to ATIF trajectories. The reference implementation lives at [`../../src/nat/atof/scripts/atof_to_atif_converter.py`](../../src/nat/atof/scripts/atof_to_atif_converter.py); the code is the source of truth for edge cases. This section documents the conventions any consumer should follow to round-trip cleanly.

### Source mapping

ATIF requires every `Step` to declare a `source ∈ {"user", "agent", "system"}`. ATOF events carry no `source` field — the converter derives it from the event's `kind`, `scope_category`, and `category`:


| ATOF event                           | Condition                                              | ATIF `source` | Step content                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "start"`   | `category == "llm"`                                    | `user`        | `message` = serialized messages array from `event.data`                                                                |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "end"`     | `category == "llm"`                                    | `agent`       | `message` = LLM response content; `tool_calls` extracted from `event.data`; `model_name` set from `category_profile.model_name` (falls back to `event.name` when `category_profile` is null). Set on every agent step emitted from an LLM scope-end; NOT set on no-LLM orchestrator steps (`llm_call_count: 0`). |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "end"`     | `category == "tool"`                                   | `system`      | merged into `observation.results[]`; consecutive tool ends flush as a single step                                      |
| `mark`                               | `data != null`                                         | `system`      | `message` = serialized `data` (null-data marks are skipped)                                                            |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "start"`   | `category == "agent"`                                  | (none)        | call-graph shaping only — `name` captured for `Trajectory.agent.name`                                                  |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "start"`   | `parent_uuid is null` and `category ∉ {"agent","llm","tool","context"}` | `user`        | **Tier-1 root boundary promotion (Branch A).** `message` = `_serialize_root_data(event.data)` (single-key-dict lift, else compact JSON; emission skipped if data is empty/None). |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "end"`     | `parent_uuid is null` and `category ∉ {"llm","tool","agent","context"}` | `agent`       | **Tier-1 root boundary promotion (Branch B).** `message` = `_serialize_root_data(event.data)` (same heuristic; emission skipped if empty/None). |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "end"`     | `parent_uuid is not null` and `category ∉ {"llm","tool","agent","context"}` | `system`      | `message` = serialized `event.data`; ancestry + invocation timing preserved. Covers inner tier-1 opaque and unclassified categories. |
| `scope`, `scope_category: "start"`   | `parent_uuid is not null` and `category ∉ {"llm","agent"}` | (none)        | call-graph shaping only — included in `extra.ancestry` chains                                                          |


**Tier-1 pass-through guarantee.** A strict tier-1 stream — every scope with `category == "unknown"` and `category_profile: null` — converts to a non-empty trajectory shaped as **user → opaque system steps → agent**. The root opaque scope's start payload is lifted into a leading `source: "user"` step (Branch A) and its end payload is lifted into a trailing `source: "agent"` step (Branch B), using the `_serialize_root_data` heuristic: a `str` is passed through; a single-key dict whose value is a string lifts that string out (covers the common `{"query": "..."}` / `{"result": "..."}` shape); any other non-empty dict serializes to compact JSON; `None` and `{}` skip emission entirely (no boundary step). Inner (non-root) opaque `scope_category: "end"` events still become `source: "system"` steps whose `message` is the serialized raw `event.data`. `Trajectory.agent.name` falls back to the outermost (root) start event's `name` when no `category == "agent"` event is present.

### Why `(kind, scope_category, category)` as dispatch key

The three string literals `"llm"`, `"tool"`, `"agent"` are the `category` values the reference converter recognizes for **specialised** ATIF-step materialisation:

- **`llm`** scopes become paired user and agent steps with messages and tool-call extraction.
- **`tool`** scopes become merged observation results buffered between LLM turns.
- **`agent`** scopes populate `Trajectory.agent.name` only (no step emitted).

All **other** scope-end events (`function`, `retriever`, `embedder`, `reranker`, `guardrail`, `evaluator`, `custom`, `unknown`) fall into the generic opaque-system-step arm — each contributes a `source: "system"` step whose `message` is the serialised raw `event.data` — **except at the root boundary**, where the converter promotes the root opaque scope-start to a `source: "user"` step (Branch A) and the root opaque scope-end to a `source: "agent"` step (Branch B) using the `_serialize_root_data` heuristic. This guarantees that **every tier produces a non-empty ATIF trajectory**: tier-1 streams yield user → opaque system → agent shapes that preserve the producer's user objective and final result; tier-2 streams enrich the inner structure with user, agent, and observation steps where scopes are classified.

### Tool-result merging

Consecutive `tool` scope-end events between two LLM turns produce **one** ATIF system step with multiple `observation.results[]`, not one step per tool result. Per Harbor's ATIF RFC, observations belong to the agent turn that produced them — a single `system` step with N results models "the system returning the results of the N tools the agent just called." Per-tool steps would inflate `step_id` counts and confuse downstream metrics.

A flush happens at three triggers:

1. **Next LLM turn begins** (`scope` event with `scope_category: "start"` and `category == "llm"`) — flushes pending observations into a single `system` step before the new `user` step is appended.
2. **`mark` event with non-null `data`** — flushes pending observations before the mark's `system` step.
3. **End of stream** — flushes any remaining observations.

### ID mappings

| `event.category_profile.model_name` (`category == "llm"`)     | `Step.model_name` (per-step)            | On every agent step emitted from an LLM scope-end; falls back to `event.name` when `category_profile` is null. NOT set on no-LLM orchestrator steps (`llm_call_count: 0`). |

### Producers that need different mappings

If your runtime emits payloads the built-in extractors don't recognize — a non-OpenAI LLM shape, a vendor-specific tool-result wrapper, or a custom `mark` convention — you have four options, ordered from cleanest to most invasive:

1. **Register a custom extractor** (recommended). Declare a `data_schema` on your events and plug a matching extractor into `nat.atof.extractors`. No core converter change is required. See [Extending the converter](#extending-the-converter) below.
2. **Wrap a known category**. Emit your custom scope as `category == "llm"` or `category == "tool"` and use `attributes` + `data` fields to carry the distinguishing semantics.
3. **Use a `mark` event with structured `data`**. For non-lifecycle observations, a `mark` with non-null `data` produces a `system` step with the data serialized into `message`. Fastest path for one-off events.
4. **Fork the reference converter**. Only needed when your category needs entirely new ATIF structural rules (new step sources, new observation shapes, and so on).

Option 1 is the right default. It keeps producer-specific parsing out of the core dispatch and composes cleanly with the JSON Schema `validator`.

### Extending the converter

The converter maintains two registries that producers plug into, both keyed on the event-level `data_schema = {name, version}` identifier.

| Registry | Purpose | Public API |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` | JSON Schema `validators` that run in a pre-pass; raise `DataSchemaViolationError` on mismatch. | `nat.atof.register_schema(name, version, schema)` |
| `LLM_EXTRACTOR_REGISTRY` / `TOOL_EXTRACTOR_REGISTRY` / `MARK_EXTRACTOR_REGISTRY` | Extractor objects that pull ATIF-relevant content out of `event.data` during conversion. | `nat.atof.register_llm_extractor(name, version, extractor)` (and `register_tool_extractor`, `register_mark_extractor`) |

Built-in defaults:

- `openai/chat-completions@1` ships with both a permissive JSON Schema and the `OpenAiChatCompletionsLlmExtractor`. Events without a `data_schema` fall back to this extractor.
- `GenericToolResultExtractor` unwraps single-key `{result}` or `{output}` wrappers and JSON-serializes the rest. Used for every `tool` scope unless overridden.
- `NatRoleMarkExtractor` lifts `mark` events whose payload carries `{"role": "user" | "system" | "agent", "content": ...}` as that-sourced ATIF steps.

#### Step 1: Declare the `data_schema` on every event you emit

The `data_schema` field is optional (spec §2), but declaring it is what activates validation and custom extractor dispatch.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
```python
from nat.atof import ScopeEvent

ScopeEvent(
    scope_category="end",
    uuid="llm-001",
    parent_uuid="root-001",
    timestamp="2026-01-01T00:00:02Z",
    name="claude-sonnet",
    category="llm",
    category_profile={"model_name": "claude-sonnet"},
    data={"output_blocks": [{"type": "text", "text": "hello"}]},
    data_schema={"name": "anthropic/messages", "version": "1"},
)
```
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

#### Step 2: Register a JSON Schema

Register the schema before calling `convert()`. The pre-pass validates every event carrying `data_schema = (name, version)` against the registered schema.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
```python
from nat.atof import register_schema

register_schema(
    "anthropic/messages",
    "1",
    {
        "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
        "type": "object",
        "anyOf": [
            {"required": ["input"]},
            {"required": ["output_blocks"]},
        ],
    },
)
```
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->


A validation failure raises `DataSchemaViolationError` with the offending event UUID, the declared schema, the JSON-pointer path to the failure, and the underlying `validator` message.

Unregistered `data_schema` values log a `WARNING` and skip validation — the converter cannot validate what it doesn't know about.

#### Step 3: Register extractors for the matching schema

Extractors are duck-typed against the protocols in `nat.atof.extractors`:

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
```python

class AnthropicMessagesV1Extractor:
    def extract_input_messages(self, data):

`register_tool_extractor` and `register_mark_extractor` work the same way for `tool` scope-ends and `mark` events. The full protocol signatures are in `nat.atof.extractors`:

```python
class LlmPayloadExtractor(Protocol):
    def extract_input_messages(self, data) -> list[dict]: ...
    def extract_output_text(self, data) -> str: ...
    def extract_tool_calls(self, data) -> list[dict]: ...

class ToolPayloadExtractor(Protocol):
    def extract_tool_result(self, data) -> str | None: ...

class MarkPayloadExtractor(Protocol):
    def extract_role_and_content(self, data) -> tuple[str, Any] | None: ...
```

#### Step 4: Convert

With the schema and extractor registered, the usual `convert()` / `convert_file()` calls handle your producer's payloads end-to-end:

```python
from nat.atof.scripts.atof_to_atif_converter import convert_file

trajectory = convert_file("my_anthropic_run.jsonl", "my_anthropic_run.atif.json")
```

#### Fail-fast guarantees

The converter raises on two kinds of producer-conformance failure, in this order:

1. `DataSchemaViolationError` — `event.data` doesn't conform to its declared, registered `data_schema`. Fires in the pre-pass with JSON-pointer context.
2. `ShapeMismatchError` — the resolved extractor returned nothing usable from a non-empty `event.data`. Fires during dispatch with the observed top-level keys.

Both exceptions carry the offending event's UUID so producers can locate the failing event quickly. Events without a `data_schema` skip validation entirely and still benefit from shape-mismatch detection against the fallback extractor.

### Known limitations

- **Tools without `category_profile.tool_call_id`.** Tool events emitted without a `category_profile.tool_call_id` (tier-1 producers that don't have provider-assigned correlation IDs) produce `observation.results[*].source_call_id == None`. The call graph can still be constructed via `parent_uuid` / `extra.ancestry`, but invocation-level correlation is lost.
- **Naive RFC 3339 timestamps.** `datetime.fromisoformat()` accepts naive ISO 8601 strings (no timezone), which spec §5.1 forbids. Naive strings reinterpret in the consumer's local timezone and can silently shift `ts_micros` by hours between environments. Producers MUST emit `Z` or an explicit UTC offset.
- **Null-data marks.** A `mark` event whose `data` field is `null` is skipped — no step is emitted. If you need a marker step with empty content, emit `data: {}` instead — the converter produces a `system` step with `message == "{}"`.

### Public API

Two entry points in [`../../src/nat/atof/scripts/atof_to_atif_converter.py`](../../src/nat/atof/scripts/atof_to_atif_converter.py):

```python
def convert(events: list[Event]) -> Trajectory:
    """In-memory: typed ATOF events → validated ATIF Trajectory."""


def convert_file(input_path: str | Path, output_path: str | Path | None = None) -> Trajectory:
    """File-based: read .jsonl → convert → optionally write ATIF JSON."""
```

Both return a Pydantic-validated `nat.atif.trajectory.Trajectory` (the Toolkit-side ATIF model that mirrors Harbor's `0001-trajectory-format.md` RFC v1.7).
