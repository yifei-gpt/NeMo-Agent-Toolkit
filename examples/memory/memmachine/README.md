# MemMachine Memory Example

**Complexity:** 🟨 Intermediate

This example demonstrates how to use [MemMachine](https://docs.memmachine.ai/) as a long-term memory backend for NeMo Agent Toolkit agents. MemMachine provides unified episodic and semantic memory management backed by PostgreSQL and Neo4j.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup)
  - [Configure MemMachine](#configure-memmachine)
  - [Start Services](#start-services)
- [Run the Example](#run-the-example)

## Key Features

- **Episodic and Semantic Memory:** Stores memories from conversations and direct facts into both episodic and semantic memory layers, enabling rich retrieval by context.
- **ReAct Agent with Memory Tools:** Demonstrates a ReAct agent equipped with `get_memory` and `add_memory` tools that can recall and persist user preferences across interactions.
- **Docker-Based MemMachine Service:** MemMachine runs as a Docker service (PostgreSQL + Neo4j + MemMachine app), so no local server process is needed in the notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running — see the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- An NVIDIA API key from [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover)
- An OpenAI API key (or AWS Bedrock credentials) for MemMachine's embedding and language models

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

Install the required packages from the **repository root**:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[langchain,memmachine]"
```

### Configure MemMachine

Edit `examples/memory/memmachine/configuration.yml` and replace the API key placeholders with your actual credentials:

- `<OPENAI_API_KEY>` — your OpenAI API key
- `<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` / `<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` — only needed if using AWS Bedrock models

The file is pre-configured to connect to the PostgreSQL and Neo4j containers using the default credentials in `docker-compose.memmachine.yml`. No changes to the database section are needed unless you override the defaults.

### Start Services

Start MemMachine (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and the MemMachine app) from the **repository root**:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.memmachine.yml up -d
```

By default, the MemMachine API is available at `http://localhost:8095`. See `examples/deploy/README.md` for full start/stop instructions.

## Run the Example

Open and run the notebook from the **repository root**:

```bash
jupyter lab examples/memory/memmachine/memmachine_memory_example.ipynb
```

The notebook walks through:

1. Connecting to the running MemMachine Docker service
2. Adding memories from conversations and directly
3. Searching memories
4. Running a ReAct agent that uses memory tools to recall and store user preferences
