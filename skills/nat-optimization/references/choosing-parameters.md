# Choosing Optimizer Parameters

`nat optimize` has several config parameters that shape a run. This file covers how to pick them and which choice is best in each case.

Defaults are a good starting point for most workflows — tune when there's a concrete reason (different sampler, deterministic agent, larger search space, endpoint capacity limits).

The sections below explain how to pick values for each.

## Choosing a Sampler

NeMo Agent Toolkit exposes three Optuna samplers via `optimizer.numeric.sampler`:

| Sampler | When to use | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bayesian` *(default)* | Continuous or mixed-type spaces, 2+ parameters, any single or multi-objective setup. Uses **TPE** for single-objective and **NSGA-II** for multi-objective (auto-selected based on `eval_metrics`). | Learns from past trials — exploits good regions, explores gaps | Needs ~10 random startup trials before the model helps; under ~15 trials it behaves like random search |
| `grid` | Small discrete spaces where exhaustive coverage is feasible (e.g. 1 param × 4 values, or 2 params × 3×3 = 9 values). | Exhaustive — no chance of missing the optimum | Scales badly with dimensions; ignores learning signal from past trials |
| `random` | Baseline for comparison, or very high-dimensional spaces where TPE's model offers little leverage. | No startup cost, embarrassingly parallel | No learning — pure luck |

**Rule of thumb:** keep the default `bayesian` unless the search space is discrete and small enough that `grid` covers it completely.

---

## Sizing `n_trials`

Pick `n_trials` based on what the sampler needs:

| Sampler | Minimum useful | Sweet spot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bayesian` | **15** — below this you're paying for TPE but getting random search | 20–30 for 1–2 params; 40–60 for 3+ |
| `grid` | `= \|search_space\|` (one trial per combination) | Same — more trials just repeat existing combinations |
| `random` | 15–30 | Scales with search volume; prefer `bayesian` once you've validated the space |

For the default `bayesian` sampler: **15 is the floor, 20 is the default, 30+ for larger search spaces.**

> **Never kill `nat optimize` mid-run to cut trials short.** The optimizer only produces its final artifacts when the study finishes cleanly. If a run is taking too long, raise parallelism (next section) — or lower `n_trials` in the config and restart if you're certain the search was oversized.

---

## Choosing `reps_per_param_set`

Each trial evaluates one parameter set on the full dataset `reps_per_param_set` times and averages the scores. Default: `3`.

| Case | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `temperature: 0` and fixed (not in `optimizable_params`) | `1` | Each trial runs a deterministic config — extra reps produce identical scores |
| `temperature` is being optimized (or fixed at any non-zero value) | `3` | Non-zero temperatures introduce sampling variance; `reps: 1` means each trial's score is one lucky (or unlucky) sample |
| Workflow uses noisy tools (web search, flaky APIs, LLM-as-judge evaluators) | `3–5` | High run-to-run variance needs more averaging regardless of which parameters are swept |

Don't base this on the baseline config's current temperature value — base it on what will actually be used during trials. A workflow with `temperature: 0` in the baseline but `optimizable_params: [temperature]` is **not** deterministic during optimization, because the optimizer sweeps non-zero values.

---

## Sizing the Prompt GA

Keep the defaults unless your case needs the deviation below or you're told otherwise. Each generation evaluates `pop` prompt variants, selects parents by fitness, breeds children via crossover and mutation, and carries the top `elitism` individuals forward unchanged. Shrinking the budget doesn't make the run faster — it breaks the GA:

- **Smaller `pop`** → fewer distinct variants to recombine. After one selection round, only the top few prompts survive; crossover then produces near-clones each generation. With `pop: 4`, the GA collapses to a single variant slowly mutating — no search.
- **Fewer `gen`** → the search doesn't converge. Generations 1–3 are exploratory (random mutations spread the population); refinement happens around generations 8–15. With `gen: 2`, you barely finish initialization.
- **`elitism: 1`** → the single best can be wiped out by a bad mutation between generations. Two elites give the runner-up as genetic backup; the GA can't regress.

If the run is slow, raise parallelism (next section) — that scales linearly without losing search quality.

### When to deviate from the defaults

Most workflows: stick with the defaults. Deviate only when the prompt space genuinely justifies it.

| Case | `ga_population_size` | `ga_generations` | When this applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** | **`24`** | **`15`** | Typical workflow — most cases |
| High | `32`–`40` | `20`–`25` | Multiple prompts evolved together, or long/complex prompts |

Set `ga_parallel_evaluations` at least to `ga_population_size` so every individual in a generation evaluates concurrently; lower only when you hit 429 rate-limit errors.

---

## Tuning Parallelism

`nat optimize` has two parallelism levers. Use both to speed up a slow run — **never shrink the dataset, and never cut `n_trials` below the sampler minimum**.

**GA individuals per generation — `ga_parallel_evaluations`.** Set to at least `ga_population_size` unless you hit 429 rate-limit errors.

**Dataset items per eval — `eval.general.max_concurrency`.** Set to `8`. Decrease only on 429 rate-limit errors or if explicitly told. See the Parallelism subsection under Evaluation in the main SKILL.md.

**Rules:**

- Total concurrent LLM calls ≈ `ga_parallel_evaluations × max_concurrency`. Keep under endpoint capacity.
- If wall-clock is too long, raise both — in this order.
- Numeric wall-clock scales as `(n_trials × dataset × reps) / max_concurrency`.
- GA wall-clock scales as `(pop × gen × dataset) / (ga_parallel × max_concurrency)`.
