# NeMo Agent Toolkit MCP and Serving

Use this skill when a workflow needs to call remote MCP tools or be served as an API.

## Workflow

1. Read the reference for the protocol or server target.
2. Keep serving configuration separate from workflow logic where possible.
3. Validate locally with a small request before adding deployment details.
4. Prefer documented `nat serve` and `nat start` commands over ad hoc servers.
