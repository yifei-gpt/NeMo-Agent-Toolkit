# Writing Custom Function Groups

It is strongly recommended to first read the [Function Groups](../workflows/function-groups.md) guide before reading this guide.

Function groups bundle related functions that share configuration and runtime context.
Use them to centralize resource management (for example, database connections) and to group functions by namespace.
It is also possible to selectively include and exclude functions, from the function group. Selective inclusion enables namespace isolation of functions within the group and makes them addressable as ordinary functions.

## Define the Configuration

Create a configuration class that inherits from {py:class}`~nat.data_models.function.FunctionGroupBaseConfig`. Use Pydantic fields for validation and documentation.

The optional `include` list controls which functions in the group become globally addressable and accessible to the workflow builder. If any function from the group is not listed in `include`, it will not be added to the global registry.
The optional `exclude` list controls which functions in the group should not be addressable and accessible to the workflow builder and also not be wrapped as tools.
If both `include` and `exclude` are empty, no functions are globally added, but you can still access the group and its functions programmatically.

:::{note}
`include` and `exclude` are mutually exclusive. If both are provided, a `ValueError` will be raised.
:::

```python
from pydantic import Field
from nat.data_models.function import FunctionGroupBaseConfig


class MyGroupConfig(FunctionGroupBaseConfig, name="my_group"):
    pass
```

## Register the Function Group

Register using {py:func}`nat.cli.register_workflow.register_function_group`. The registered coroutine should yield a {py:class}`~nat.builder.function.FunctionGroup` instance.

```python
from nat.cli.register_workflow import register_function_group
from nat.builder.workflow_builder import Builder
from nat.builder.function import FunctionGroup

@register_function_group(config_type=MyGroupConfig)
async def build_my_group(config: MyGroupConfig, _builder: Builder):
    group = FunctionGroup(config=config, instance_name="my")

    async def greet_fn(name: str) -> str:
        """Return a friendly greeting given a name."""
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    async def shout_fn(message: str) -> str:
        """Return a message in uppercase."""
        return message.upper()

    group.add_function(name="greet", fn=greet_fn, description=greet_fn.__doc__)
    group.add_function(name="shout", fn=shout_fn, description=shout_fn.__doc__)

    yield group
```

## Referencing Functions within a Function Group

Functions are referenced as `instance_name.function_name` (for example, `my.greet`).

```python
async with WorkflowBuilder() as builder:
    await builder.add_function_group("my", MyGroupConfig(include=["greet"]))

    # Able to reference the function directly by its fully qualified name
    greet = builder.get_function("my.greet")
    print(await greet.ainvoke("World"))

    my_group = builder.get_function_group("my")

    # Get all accessible functions in the function group.
    # If the function group is configured to:
    # - include some functions, this will return only the included functions.
    # - not include or exclude any function, this will return all functions in the group.
    # - exclude some functions, this will return all functions in the group except the excluded functions.
    accessible_functions = my_group.get_accessible_functions()
    
    # Get all functions in the group.
    # This will return all functions in the group, regardless of whether they are included or excluded.
    all_functions = my_group.get_all_functions()

    # Or only the included functions (which have also been registered globally as ordinary functions)
    included_functions = my_group.get_included_functions()

    # Or only the excluded functions
    excluded_functions = my_group.get_excluded_functions()
```

## Input Schemas

When you add a function with {py:meth}`~nat.builder.function.FunctionGroup.add_function`, the toolkit infers input/output schemas from the callable's type hints. You can override the input schema and attach converters if needed:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from nat.builder.function_info import FunctionInfo


class GreetingInput(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Name to greet", min_length=1)


async def greet_fn(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


group.add_function(name="greet",
                   fn=greet_fn,
                   input_schema=GreetingInput,
                   description="Return a friendly greeting")
```

## Best Practices

- Keep group instance names short and descriptive; they become part of function names.
- Share expensive resources (for example, clients, caches) through the group context instead of recreating them per function.
- Validate inputs with Pydantic schemas for robust error handling.

## Next Steps

- Review [Writing Custom Functions](./functions.md) for details that also apply to functions inside groups (type safety, streaming vs. single outputs, converters).
