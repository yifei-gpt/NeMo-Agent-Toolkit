# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Release Notes

## Release 1.1.0
### Summary
* [Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/v1.1.0/docs/source/workflows/mcp/index.md). Workflows/tools can now be exposed as MCP servers.
* Deep integration with [Weights and Biases’ Weave](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/v1.1.0/docs/source/workflows/observe/observe-workflow-with-weave.md) for logging and tracing support.
* Addition of the [Agno](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/v1.1.0/examples/agno_personal_finance/README.md) LLM framework.
* A new [ReWOO agent](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/v1.1.0/examples/agents/rewoo/README.md) that improves on ReAct by removing the tool output from the LLM context, reducing token counts.
* A new [Alert Triage Agent example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/v1.1.0/examples/alert_triage_agent/README.md) that demonstrates how to build a full application with NeMo Agent toolkit to automatically analyze system monitoring alerts, performs diagnostic checks using various tools, and generates structured triage reports with root cause categorization.
* Support for Python 3.11.
* Various other improvements.
