# Configure the Tool Calling Agent
Configure the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit tool calling agent as a workflow or a function.

## Requirements
The tool calling agent requires the `nvidia-nat[langchain]` plugin, which can be installed with one of the following commands.

- If you have performed a source code checkout:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

- If you have installed the NeMo Agent toolkit from a package:

```bash
uv pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
```

## Configuration
The tool calling agent may be utilized as a workflow or a function.

### Example 1: Tool Calling Agent as a Workflow to Configure `config.yml`
To use the tool calling agent as a workflow, configure the YAML file as follows:
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: tool_calling_agent
  tool_names: [wikipedia_search, current_datetime, code_generation]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  handle_tool_errors: true
```

### Example 2: Tool Calling Agent as a Function to Configure `config.yml`
In your YAML file, to use the tool calling agent as a function:
```yaml
function_groups:
  calculator:
    _type: calculator
functions:
  math_agent:
    _type: tool_calling_agent
    tool_names: [calculator]
    llm_name: agent_llm
    verbose: true
    handle_tool_errors: true
    description: 'Useful for performing simple mathematical calculations.'
```

### Configurable Options

* `workflow_alias`: Defaults to `None`. The alias of the workflow. Useful when the Tool Calling agent is configured as a workflow and need to expose a customized name as a tool.

* `tool_names`: A list of tools that the agent can call. The tools must be functions or function groups configured in the YAML file

* `llm_name`: The LLM the agent should use. The LLM must be configured in the YAML file

* `verbose`: Defaults to False (useful to prevent logging of sensitive data). If set to True, the agent will log input, output, and intermediate steps.

* `handle_tool_errors`: Defaults to True. All tool errors will be caught and a `ToolMessage` with an error message will be returned, allowing the agent to retry.

* `max_iterations`: Defaults to 15. The maximum number of tool calls the agent may perform.

* `return_direct`: Optional list of tool names that should return their output directly without additional agent processing. When a tool in this list is called, its response is returned immediately to the user, bypassing the agent's reasoning step.

* `description`:  Defaults to "Tool Calling Agent Workflow". When the agent is configured as a function, this config option allows us to control the tool description (for example, when used as a tool within another agent).

## Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Tool-Calling Agent

1. **User Query** – The agent receives an input or problem to solve.
2. **Function Matching** – The agent determines the best tool to call based on the input.
3. **Tool Execution** – The agent calls the tool with the necessary parameters.
4. **Response Handling** – The tool returns a structured response, which the agent passes to the user.

### **Example Walkthrough**

Imagine a tool-calling agent needs to answer:

> "What’s the current weather in New York?"

#### Single Step Execution
1. **User Query:** "What’s the current weather in New York?"
2. **Function Matching:** The agent identifies the `get_weather(location)` tool.
3. **Tool Execution:** Calls `get_weather("New York")`.
4. **Response Handling:** The tool returns `72°F, clear skies`, and the agent directly provides the answer.

Since tool calling agents execute function calls directly, they are more efficient for structured tasks that don’t require intermediate reasoning.

## Limitations
The following are the limitations of tool calling agents:

* Requires an LLM that supports tool calling or function calling.

* Does not perform complex reasoning and decision-making between tool calls.

* Since it uses the tool name, description, and input parameters, it requires well-named input parameters for each tool.
