# About the Responses API and Agent

The NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit supports OpenAI's Responses API through two complementary pieces:

- Configuring the [LLM](../../../build-workflows/llms/index.md) client mode using the `api_type` field 
- Integrating tool binding with the NeMo Agent toolkit dual-node graph using the dedicated workflow [agent](../index.md) `_type: responses_api_agent`, designed for tool use with the Responses API.

The Responses API enables models to: 
- Use built-in tools such as Code Interpreter through `builtin_tools`.
- Connect to remote tools using Model Context Protocol (MCP) through `mcp_tools`, specifying fields such as `server_label` and `server_url`.
- Use toolkit tools through `nat_tools`, executed by the agent graph.

To configure your LLM agent for the Responses API and use the dedicated agent, refer to [Configure the Responses API and Agent](./responses-api-and-agent.md).
