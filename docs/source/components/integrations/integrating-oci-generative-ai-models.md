# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit OCI Integration

The NeMo Agent Toolkit supports integration with multiple [LLM](../../build-workflows/llms/index.md) providers, including OCI Generative AI. The `oci` provider uses OCI SDK authentication and is designed for OCI Generative AI model and endpoint access. For workflow parity with the AWS Bedrock path, the toolkit also includes a LangChain wrapper built on `langchain-oci`.

To view the full list of supported LLM providers, run `nat info components -t llm_provider`.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites
Before integrating OCI, ensure you have:

- access to OCI Generative AI in the target region
- a valid OCI auth method such as `API_KEY`, `SECURITY_TOKEN`, `INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL`, or `RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL`
- the target compartment OCID
- the target OCI region (defaults to `us-chicago-1`) or a custom endpoint URL

Common deployment patterns include:

- OCI Generative AI regional endpoints
- custom OCI Generative AI endpoints
- OCI-hosted inference for NVIDIA Nemotron used as a live integration target

### Example Configuration
Add the OCI LLM configuration to your workflow config file:

```yaml
llms:
  oci_llm:
    _type: oci
    model_name: nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1
    region: us-chicago-1
    compartment_id: ocid1.compartment.oc1..example
    auth_type: API_KEY
    auth_profile: DEFAULT
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 1024
    top_p: 1.0
    request_timeout: 60
```

### Configurable Options
* `model_name`: The name of the OCI-hosted model to use (required)
* `region`: OCI region for the Generative AI service (defaults to `us-chicago-1`). The service endpoint is derived automatically.
* `endpoint`: Optional explicit service endpoint URL. Overrides the region-derived endpoint when set.
* `compartment_id`: OCI compartment OCID
* `auth_type`: OCI SDK auth type
* `auth_profile`: OCI profile name for file-backed auth
* `auth_file_location`: Path to the OCI config file
* `provider`: Optional OCI provider override such as `meta`, `google`, `cohere`, or `openai`
* `temperature`: Controls randomness in the output (0.0 to 1.0)
* `max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate
* `top_p`: Top-p sampling parameter (0.0 to 1.0)
* `seed`: Optional random seed
* `max_retries`: Maximum number of retries for the request
* `request_timeout`: HTTP request timeout in seconds

### Limitations
* This provider targets OCI Generative AI through the OCI SDK-backed `langchain-oci` path.
* The Responses API is not enabled for this provider in the current release.

## Nemotron On OCI

One strong OCI deployment pattern is NVIDIA Nemotron hosted on OCI and exposed through an OpenAI-compatible route. In that setup, the toolkit can validate live integration behavior against the OCI-hosted Nemotron endpoint while the official provider and LangChain wrapper cover the OCI Generative AI path.

## Usage
Reference the OCI LLM in your configuration:

```yaml
llms:
  oci_llm:
    _type: oci
    model_name: nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1
    region: us-chicago-1
    compartment_id: ocid1.compartment.oc1..example
    auth_profile: DEFAULT
```

## Troubleshooting
* `401 Unauthorized`: verify the OCI profile, signer, and IAM permissions for Generative AI.
* `404 Not Found`: confirm the regional endpoint or custom endpoint URL is correct.
* `Connection errors`: verify OCI networking and that the regional endpoint is reachable.
* `Tool calling issues`: verify the served model supports tool calling and that the serving stack is configured for it.
