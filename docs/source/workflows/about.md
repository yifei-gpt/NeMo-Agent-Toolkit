# About NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

Workflows are the core of the NeMo Agent toolkit because they define which agentic tools and models are used to perform a given task or series of tasks.

## Understanding the Workflow Configuration File

The workflow configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the tools and models to use in a workflow, along with general configuration settings. This section examines the configuration of the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow to show how they are organized.

`examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml`:
```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime

llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    temperature: 0.0

embedders:
  nv-embedqa-e5-v5:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
```

This workflow configuration is divided into four sections: `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow`. The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow, while `llms` and `embedders` define the models used in the workflow, and lastly the `workflow` section ties the other sections together and defines the workflow itself.

In this workflow, the `webpage_query` tool queries the LangSmith User Guide, and the `current_datetime` tool gets the current date and time. The `description` entry instructs the LLM when and how to use the tool. In this case, the workflow explicitly defines `description` for the `webpage_query` tool.

The `webpage_query` tool uses the `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` embedder, which is defined in the `embedders` section.

For details on workflow configuration, including sections not utilized in the above example, refer to the [Workflow Configuration](./workflow-configuration.md) document.

## Using Agents With Workflows
There are several different agents that use language models. They are systems that use LLMs to reason and determine the actions to take and inputs to use for those actions. After executing those actions, the agent uses the LLM to determine if more actions are required. The following are agents and an executor offered by NeMo Agent toolkit:
- [ReAct Agent](../workflows/react-agent/index.md)
- [Reasoning Agent](../workflows/reasoning-agent/index.md)
- [ReWOO Agent](../workflows/rewoo-agent/index.md)
- [Responses API and Agent](../workflows/responses-api-and-agent/index.md)
- [Router Agent](../workflows/router-agent/index.md)
- [Sequential Executor](../workflows/sequential-executor/index.md)
- [Tool Calling Agent](../workflows/tool-calling-agent/index.md)
