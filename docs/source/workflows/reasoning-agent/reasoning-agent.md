# Configure a Reasoning Agent
Configure the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit reasoning agent as a workflow or a function. We recommend using the reasoning wrapper with any NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit function that could improve performance from task-specific plan generation.
---

## Requirements
The reasoning agent requires the `nvidia-nat[langchain]` plugin, which can be installed with one of the following commands.

- If you have performed a source code checkout:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

- If you have installed the NeMo Agent toolkit from a package:

```bash
uv pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
```

## Configuration

The reasoning agent can be used as a workflow or a function. Follow the example below to configure your `config.yml` YAML file.

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: reasoning_agent
  llm_name: nemotron_model
  # The augmented_fn is the nat Function that the execution plan is passed to. Usually an agent entry point.
  augmented_fn: react_agent
  verbose: true
```

### Configurable Options
The following are more ways you can configure your config file when using the reasoning agent:
* `workflow_alias`: Defaults to `None`. The alias of the workflow. Useful when the Reasoning agent is configured as a workflow and need to expose a customized name as a tool.

* `llm_name`: The LLM the agent should use. The LLM must be configured in the YAML file. The LLM must support thinking tags.

* `verbose`: Defaults to False (useful to prevent logging of sensitive data). If set to True, the agent will log input, output, and intermediate steps.

* `augmented_fn`: The function to reason on. The function should be an agent and must be defined in the config YAML.

* `reasoning_prompt_template`: The prompt used in the first step of the reasoning agent. Defaults to:
  ```python
  """
  You are an expert reasoning model task with creating a detailed execution plan for a system that has the following description

  **Description:**
  {augmented_function_desc}

  Given the following input and a list of available tools, please provide a detailed step-by-step plan that an instruction following system can use to address the input. Ensure the plan includes:
  1. Identifying the key components of the input.
  2. Determining the most suitable tools for each task.
  3. Outlining the sequence of actions to be taken.

  **Input:**
  {input_text}

  **Tools and description of the tool:**
  {tools}

  An example plan could look like this:
  1. Call tool A with input X
  2. Call tool B with input Y
  3. Interpret the output of tool A and B
  4. Return the final result

  **PLAN:**
  {plan}
  """
  ```


* `instruction_prompt_template`: The prompt used in the final step of the reasoning agent.  Defaults to:
  ```python
  """
  Answer the following question based on message history: {input_text}

  Here is a plan for execution that you could use to guide you if you wanted to:
  {reasoning_output}

  NOTE: Remember to follow your guidance on how to format output, etc.

  You must respond with the answer to the original question directly to the user.
  """
  ```

---

## The Reasoning Agent Workflow
When you enter a prompt with the reasoning agent, it runs through the following workflow:
1. **User Query** – The agent receives an input or problem to solve.
2. **Reasoning on top of Function** – The agent reasons the best plan of action to take, based on the input and the augmented underlying function.
3. **Instruction / Plan Execution** – The agent invokes the underlying function, passing its plan of action along to it.

For an example of using reasoning agent with the ReAct agent, refer to [Run the Workflow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/tree/develop/examples/agents/react#run-the-workflow).

## Limitations
The following are the limitations of reasoning agents:
* Requires a thinking/reasoning LLM, such as DeepSeek R1. There should be thought tags within the LLM output:
  >&lt;think&gt;&lt;/think&gt;

* Performs reasoning up front and does not revisit the plan to revise strategy during execution like a ReAct agent does. Revising the strategy is beneficial if a tool returns a non-useful response (let's say our retriever tool did not have any relevant search results to the user's original question).
